# SpiderImageRecognition
This the Python backend for my deep learning computer vision project for recognizing spiders from images. It uses Tensorflow+Keras to train an Xception model on a dataset pulled from communitee generated image sites such as INaturalist and SpiderID. The model is hosted on Flask server that handles all pre-processing to reduce the amount of work frontends have to do to use the server.
